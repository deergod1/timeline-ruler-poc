# Timeline Ruler POC

**Status:** Step 1 Complete ✅ | Step 2-4 Pending  
**Running:** `http://localhost:3001` (port 3000 in use by main project)

## Project Context

This is a **separate POC project** for the Timeline Ruler feature from the Family Journal app. Created to avoid cluttering the main project while experimenting with sophisticated timeline visualization concepts.

**Based on:** `timeline-ruler-specification.md` - A vertical timeline with focus-based magnification, logarithmic scaling, and advanced interaction patterns.

## Current Implementation (Step 1 ✅)

### Core Files

- `src/lib/synthetic-data.ts` - Generates 2-3 years of realistic journal data
- `src/components/TimelineRuler.tsx` - Vertical timeline component
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Demo page with current focus display
- `timeline-ruler-specification.md` - Full specification

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Vertical timeline with synthetic data (2022-2024)
- ✅ Density visualization (bar thickness = entry count)
- ✅ Clickable navigation with hover tooltips
- ✅ Realistic patterns (holidays, weekends, photo clusters)
- ✅ Current position highlighting

### Data Patterns

- **Busy periods:** Holidays, vacations (higher entry probability)
- **Quiet periods:** Weekends (lower probability)
- **Photo clusters:** Correlated with entry count
- **Gap detection:** Empty periods between active days

## Next Steps (3 Remaining)

### Step 2: Visual Enhancements

- Add photo indicators (small dots on timeline)
- Visual breaks for empty periods
- Recent activity highlighting
- Enhanced visual hierarchy

### Step 3: Focus-Based Magnification

- Logarithmic scaling around focal point
- Progressive magnification
- Distance-based compression
- Smooth focus transitions

### Step 4: Advanced Interaction

- Continuous drag navigation
- Inertia-based motion (flick to coast)
- Möbius translation with physics
- Dynamic LOD with performance optimization

## Key Concepts

**Hyperbolic Viewer:** Smoothly decreases resolution with distance from focal point, expanding area around focus while compressing distant areas.

**Logarithmic Scaling:** Mathematical scaling around focal point, like camera lens or microscope around target date.

**Möbius Translation:** Smooth, hardware-accelerated time navigation with inertia-based motion.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Same stack as main Family Journal project
- Separate project to avoid dependency conflicts

## Development Notes

- Building incrementally to validate each concept
- Each step adds complexity while maintaining working state
- Focus on user experience and performance optimization
- Ready to continue with Step 2 or test current implementation
